- **Description:** A project that implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations using an asynchronous JSON backend with json-server. A step further towards understanding data management and full-stack development.

>[!WARNING]
> ***To test all the projects, just run the .js files in the browser, with the exception of `06 - Doguito Petshop (CRUD Async json-server backend)` and `05 - To Do List (DOM Manipulation and Modularization)`. For project 05, it is necessary to raise the page on a web server and for project 06, you need to follow the next steps:***
>    - Download the folder in zip (recommended) or clone the repository
>    - Unzip the folder if you downloaded it
>    - Run the lista_cliente.html file (it is 100% necessary to do it on a web server due to http protocol rules)
>    - Raise a backend server with the db.json file, I used npm's json-server for this, following these commands in the terminal of the root folder:
~~~
npm install json-server
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted (you need to run the terminal with administrator permissions to do this)
json-server .\db.json
~~~
And done, that's how I temporarily mounted the page's backend server
